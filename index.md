## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

# Dwayne's First CS193 Homework

## Thing's I love about CS193
- It's taught by students just like me (so there is some relatability)
- My instructors Rohan and Elijah are chill guys that one day I'll have the courage to talk to 
- The Syllabus seems relevant as someone who wants to be a Software Engineer in the future
- The Quizzes are easy!!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
